# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Analysis Overview
Using deep learning and neural networks via the TensorFlow platform in Python, an analysis of the data in the `charity_data.csv` to classify the success of charitable donations. This information will help predict whether the applicants will be successful if funded by AlphabetSoup.

Three Steps to Accomplish Analysis:
1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model
